		<p>Believe it or not these are permissions requested by an application from Google Play supposed to be a celebrity face recognition game. And it has 1 to 5 millions installs. Amazing!</p>
		<p>I tried to find out why developer may need those permission since beside in-app purchases all other have no reason. Of course, I got no answer.</p>
		<p>Now, I cannot prove this application is actually doing but it is granted by Android operating system the rights to record sounds from microphone and send to another device. And because it prevent device from sleeping it can run while device seems to be on standby.</p>
		<p>And at least one million users are exposed to this kind of attack.</p>
		<a href="https://support.google.com/googleplay/answer/6014972?p=app_permissions&amp;rd=1">Google Play Support</a>
		<p>Anyway, applications that abuse user private data are not the norm. Vast majority requires, beside in-app purchasing, only networking access, perhaps to load content, or even no special privileges.</p>

		<h2>ADAPTIVE LEARNING CYCLE.</h2>
		<p>Computing Technologies are New Mediums - Paper and pencils have been around for centuries and we understand their best uses; computers, however, are still relatively new</p>
		<p>Corollary - You can't simply digitize existing technologies and expect to revolutionize anything, e.g. online textbooks are just a convenience</p>
		<p>Lau explained his take on the concept of "spaced repetition," wherein the absolute best time to review material is right before you forget it. Fortunately, this pattern of forgetting is extremely predictable, although it varies slightly from student to student. Rosetta Stone, the most famous language learning software, and the open source flashcard software Anki both use this same technique.</p>
		<p>Finally, Lau closed with an example of his "perfect" tutor: a personalized teaching computer from the recent Star Trek movie. "I'm a huge geek, I've always wanted to show something like this," said Lau. "We're getting to the point where these science fiction ideas are almost here."</p>
		<p>In my own experience, "individual learning" in high school was an excuse for teachers to not teach and to expect students to learn the material on their own time at home. Is our current paradigm of the teacher-classroom model not the most effective one? I don't believe simply handing a student a textbook is effective either, but is there a happy medium that will replace schools entirely and that leverages the analytical abilities of computers to learn how students learn?</p>

		<p>Did you ever wonder what device ID and call information means? It is a permission requested by some apps and if you accept, that app is able to retrieve your phone number and all phone numbers you are talking with. Now, is obvious a kids learning app has no need for such permission; the only reason that permission is requested is to spy on you.</p>

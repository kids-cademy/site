	<disclaimer>While there are not evidences still there are rumors that using mobile devices for more than couple hours daily is not recommended. This is especially true for preschool children... Computers and related technologies are great for learning but should not replace real life interaction. Objects on screens are virtual while real life objects signals more stimuli: tactile, real 3-D contour, smell, taste and more important affection. Therefore is recommended to use computers as learning tools and play with real objects.</disclaimer>

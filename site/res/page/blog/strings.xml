	<p2>We, at kids (a)cademy hate ads and, we are pretty sure of that, free apps users too. How mean a developer to be to create a free app for kids and fill it with ads and in-app items purchasing! And is also pointless since is a known fact that kids have low interest in advertisement ;-)</p2>
	<p3>We strongly believe there should be more elegant ways to sustain a business. Therefore all ours apps are ads free, including for free apps.</p3>

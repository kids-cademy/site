it seems tomcat has a cache for static files - somethig about 5 seconds, and if file is requested 
while cache is active the stored version is returned, not even testing for changing on file system

media repository context should disable tomcat cache
otherwise waveform.png is not updated correctly

<Context reloadable="true" cachingAllowed="false"></Context>

configuring cache expiration on web.xml is optional since javascript uses timestamp to render url as unique
